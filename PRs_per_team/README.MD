This package contains two files

* `AgentTeams.txt`: The list of teams labels that are contributing to the Agent code. This list needs to be maintained.
* `PRs_per_team.sh`  

This script has two functions:
- `collect_bugfixes()`: This function will be collecting, for every team entry from the `AgentTeans.txt`:
  * The total number of PRs
  * The number of PRs fixing functional bugs
  * The number of PRs fixing security bugs
  * The number of PRs fixing performance bugs

- `collect_QAed_PRs()`: This function will be collecting, for every team entry from the `AgentTeans.txt`:
  * The total number of PRs
  * The number of PRs with `qa/done` label
  * The number of PRs with `qa/no-code-change` label

**How to run it?**
- Make sure you have the token file to be able to auth to github
- From your terminal run the following command: ` ./PRs_per_team.sh`, you'll then be promped to:
  - Enter a `milestone`
  - Choose what function to run: `QA/Bugfixes/both`: Given the chosen parameter, one or both of the functions mentioned above will be run.

Every function generate a file:
* `ratio_perteam_$version.csv`: Will contain the data generated by `collect_bugfixes()`. You can use it to update the [bugfix_ration_per_team](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gLFxRx1bBDVBMb24aRAtAN2MeevTFnK7Sz3mSFoL1F8/edit#gid=1313700550) file.
* `QAed_prs_$version.csv`: Will contain the data generated by `collect_QAed_PRs()`. You can use it to update the [Number of QAed PRs before code freeze per release](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/183di6QOfH-7clTnwvXnhG7J-SzlFhQ8bRcKx6fSYUlg/edit#gid=0) file.
